You might imagine creating new types of ParserListeners, like an AnimationParserListener, that depend on knowing about the musical events before they happen. For example, perhaps your animation is of a robot playing a drum or strumming a guitar. Before the note makes a sound, the animation needs to get its virtual hands in the right place, so you might want a notice 500ms earlier that a musical event is about to happen. To bend time with JFugue, use a combination of the TemporalPLP class and Player.delayPlay(). delayPlay() creates a new thread that first waits the specified amount of time before playing. If you do this, make sure to call delayPlay() before plp.parse().
