You can use JFugue to convert between music formats. Most commonly, JFugue is used to turn Staccato music into MIDI sound. Alternatively, you can play with the MIDI, MusicXML, and LilyPond parsers and listeners. Or, you can easily create your own parser or listener, and it will instantly interoperate with the other existing formats. (And if you convert to Staccato, you can then play the Staccato music... and edit it!)
